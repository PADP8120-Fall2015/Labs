## Goals for Today   

1. Perform (and understand) basic transformations

2. Compare transformed and untransformed models

3. Gain intuition about why/when to transform

4. Standardize and interpret standardized variables


##

For today's lab, we will use the dataset of Michael Ross, "Does Oil Hinder Democracy?" *World Politics*, 2001. That paper estimated a time series cross-section model of Polity scores regressed on oil exports and a battery of controls.

```{r, results='hide',message=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
rossdata_url <- "http://staff.washington.edu/csjohns/503/rossoildata.csv"
rossdata_raw <- read.csv(rossdata_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
rossdata <- rossdata_raw %>%
  select(cty_name, year, regime1, oil, GDPcap, oecd) %>%
  na.omit()

```

(@) Let's run the standard model from Ross for the relationship between oil and GDP.

```{r}
model1 <- lm(regime1 ~ GDPcap + oil + oecd + year, data = rossdata)
summary(model1)
```

(@) Now predict the expected value of regime type vs. oil, for non-OECD countries with mean GDP per-capita and median year. 
 
```{r}
pred1_df <- data.frame(oil = seq(0, 100, by = 10),
                       GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap), 
                       oecd = 0,
                       year = median(rossdata$year))
pred1 <- predict(model1, newdata = pred1_df, interval = "confidence")

ggplot(bind_cols(pred1_df, as.data.frame(pred1)),
       aes(x = oil, y = fit, ymin = lwr, ymax = upr)) + 
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_line()
```


(@) Now, repeat this with both OECD and non-OECD countries. Before plotting, 
how will these differ? 

```{r}
pred2_df <- expand.grid(oil = seq(0, 100, by = 10),
                        GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap), 
                        oecd = c(0, 1),
                        year = median(rossdata$year))
pred2 <- predict(model1, newdata = pred2_df, interval = "confidence")
ggplot(bind_cols(pred2_df, as.data.frame(pred2)),
       aes(x = oil, y = fit, ymin = lwr, ymax = upr,
           colour = factor(oecd), fill = factor(oecd))) + 
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.2, colour = NA) +
  geom_line()
```


(@) Does it make sense to plot `oil` from 0 to 100? Check the range of `oil`.

Surprisingly, not that bad.
```{r}
summary(rossdata$oil)
ggplot(rossdata, aes(x = oil)) + geom_density() + geom_rug()
```


(@) Interact `oil` with `oecd` and plot (keeping `GDPcap` at the mean, and `year` at the median. What will the lines look like?

```{r}
model2 <- lm(regime1 ~ GDPcap + oil * oecd + year, data = rossdata)
summary(model2)
```

```{r}
pred.mod2_df <- expand.grid(oil = seq(0, 100, by = 10),
                        GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap), 
                        oecd = c(0, 1),
                        year = median(rossdata$year))
pred.mod2 <- predict(model2, newdata = pred.mod2_df, interval = "confidence")
ggplot(bind_cols(pred.mod2_df, as.data.frame(pred.mod2)),
       aes(x = oil, y = fit, ymin = lwr, ymax = upr,
           colour = factor(oecd), fill = factor(oecd))) + 
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.2, colour = NA) +
  geom_line()
```

(@) Now consider the interaction of `oil` with `year`. How would you plot two continuous variables?

```{r}
model3 <- lm(regime1 ~ GDPcap + oecd + oil * year, data = rossdata)
summary(model3)
```

In order to interpret the interaction term graphically, we need to pick one variable to treat as continuous --- the x-axis --- and another for which we will choose specific values. Use `oil` as the x-axis, and some values of `year` at which to evaluate it.
For `year` we could use the min, max, and median.

```{r}
pred3_newdata <- expand.grid(oecd = 0,
                             GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap),
                             year = c(1966, 1981, 1997),
                             oil = seq(0, 100, by = 10))
pred3 <- predict(model3, newdata = pred3_newdata, interval = "confidence")
pred3 <- cbind(pred3,pred3_newdata)
```
Now, let's plot it,
```{r}
ggplot(pred3, aes(x = oil, y = fit,
                  ymin = lwr,
                  ymax = upr,
                  colour = factor(year),fill=factor(year))) +
  geom_line() + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2) +
  scale_colour_discrete("year")
```

## First Differences

A common way of comparing the effect of a variable is to compare the results on $\hat{y}$
for a variable at its mean and at its mean plus one standard deviation, holding
all other variables at their means (if continuous), and their 
```{r}
year_seq <- seq(min(rossdata$year), max(rossdata$year), by = 1)
oil_lo <- mean(rossdata$GDPcap)
oil_hi <- mean(rossdata$GDPcap) + sd(rossdata$GDPcap)
pred3_oil_lo <-
  predict(model3,
          newdata = data.frame(year = year_seq,
                               GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap), 
                               oil = oil_lo,
                               oecd = 0),
          interval = "confidence")

pred3_oil_hi <-
  predict(model3,
          newdata = data.frame(year = year_seq,
                               GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap), 
                               oil = oil_hi,
                               oecd = 0),
          interval = "confidence")
```

The first difference is calculated.
Note that there are no standard error associated with these differences.
```{r}
pred3_diff <- data.frame(year = year_seq,
                         diff = pred3_oil_hi[ , "fit"] - pred3_oil_lo[ , "fit"])
head(pred3_diff)
```
We could plot these differences over time.
```{r}
ggplot(pred3_diff, aes(x = year, y = diff)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous("Change in democracy")
```

# Transformations

What if we suspect the effect of oil is non-linear?

Specifying a model:
```{r}
model4 <- lm(regime1 ~ GDPcap + oil + I(oil^2) + oecd, data = rossdata)
summary(model4)

oil_hyp <- seq(from = 0.01, to = 100, by = 10)
pred4 <- predict(model4,
                 newdata = data.frame(oil = oil_hyp,
                                      GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap),
                                      oecd = 0),
                 interval = "confidence") %>%
  as.data.frame()
pred4$oil <- oil_hyp
```

Plotting the resulting expectations:
```{r}
ggplot(pred4, aes(x = oil)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = upr, ymin = lwr), alpha = 1/3) +
  labs(x = "Percent oil", y = "Expected level of democracy", title = "Relationship of oil and democracy, with quadratic transformation of oil")
```


(@) Transform GDP per capita by log and refit the model

```{r}
model_logGDP <- lm(regime1 ~ log(GDPcap) + oil + oecd, data = rossdata)
summary(model_logGDP)

gdp_hyp <- seq(from = min(rossdata$GDPcap), to = max(rossdata$GDPcap), length.out = 50)
pred.logGDP <- predict(model_logGDP,
newdata = data.frame(oil = median(oil_hyp),
                                      GDPcap = gdp_hyp,
                                      oecd = 0),
                 interval = "confidence") %>%
  as.data.frame()
pred.logGDP$gdp <- gdp_hyp
```

(@) Why was median used there?

We use the median here because it doesn't really make sense to think about "average years".

(@) Plot the resulting expectations:
```{r}
ggplot(pred.logGDP, aes(x = gdp)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = upr, ymin = lwr), alpha = 1/3) +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Expected level of democracy", title = "Relationship of log(GDP per capita) and democracy")
```

(@) Transform oil by log. What happens?  How would you solve it?

```{r error=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
rossdata %>% mutate(l.oil = log(oil)) %>% summary(.$l.oil)
```

Log of 0 is undefined. This is often handled by adding and arbitrary small value to 0's. In this case we'll add 0.001. 
There are better ways to deal with this, but for now...

```{r}
model5 <- lm(regime1 ~ GDPcap + log(oil_mod) + oecd,
             data = mutate(rossdata, oil_mod = log(oil + 0.001)))
summary(model5)

pred5 <- predict(model5,
                 newdata = data.frame(oil_mod = seq(from = 0.01, to = 100, by = 10),
                                      GDPcap = mean(rossdata$GDPcap),
                                      oecd = 0),
                 interval = "confidence")
```


# Post-estimation Diagnostics

Recall the default model,
```{r}
model1
```

Extract residuals and fitted values from an `lm` object:
```{r eval=TRUE}
result.vals = data.frame(residuals = model1$residuals,fitted = model1$fitted.values,outcome = rossdata$regime1,std.resids = rstandard(model1))
```

(@) Plot the fitted values vs. the outcome variable to look for nonlinearity,

```{r}
ggplot(result.vals, aes(y = fitted,x = outcome)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ylab("E(Democracy | X)") +
  xlab("Democracy")
```

and the residuals vs. the fitted values to look for heteroskedasticity

```{r}
ggplot(result.vals, aes(x = fitted, y = residuals)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "red") + 
  ylab("Residual") +
  xlab("E(Democracy | X)")
```

(@) What accounts for the unusual patterns? *hint:* What values can Democracy take?

```{r}
table(rossdata$regime1)
```

It is obvious in this case, but plotting the sqrt of the absolute value of the standardized residuals errors can make it more clear
```{r}
  ggplot(result.vals, aes(x = fitted, y = sqrt(abs(std.resids)))) + 
#ggplot(model1_aug, aes(x = .fitted, y = sqrt(abs(.std.resid)))) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "red") + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  ylab("Residual") +
  xlab("E(Democracy | X)")
```


(@) For model 1, plot residuals against each independent variable and the fitted values. 
Is there evidence of heteroskedasticity or nonlinearity?

```{r}
results = data.frame(residuals = model1$residuals,fitted = model1$fitted.values,std.resids = rstandard(model1),rossdata)
plot(fitted~regime1,results)
```

Eh, doesn't look super bad, but not great either. 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(std.resids~GDPcap,results)
abline(h=2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=-2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=0,lty=2)
plot(std.resids~oil,results)
abline(h=2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=-2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=0,lty=2)
plot(std.resids~oecd,results)
abline(h=2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=-2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=0,lty=2)
plot(std.resids~year,results)
abline(h=2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=-2,lty=2,col='red');abline(h=0,lty=2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Definitely heteroskedasticity, with regards to both GDP per-capita and oil (in both cases, high variance at low levels and low variance at high levels)

(@) What about the normality of errors? 

```{r}
ggplot(results, aes(sample = std.resids)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1)
```

For more advanced residual plots see **car** functions:

- `avPlots`: added variable plot
- `ceresPlots`, `crPlots`: Component + residual (partial residual) plots
- `residualPlots`

Also try using `plot` on an `lm` object:
```{r eval=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model1)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
