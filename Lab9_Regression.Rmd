# Lab Topics

- Linear regression

##Goals:

After this lab you will be able to:
- explain what is a regression line and what is a residual is words, equations, and pictures
- explain the relationship between a regression coefficient and a correlation coefficent in words, equations, and pictures

## 
This lab uses materials by 
- Andrew Bray and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel
- Gael Varoquaux (https://github.com/cogmaster-stats)
- Matthew Salganik

## 

After this class you will have basic facility with simple linear models, including being able to
- explain what is a regression line and what is a residual is words, equations, and pictures
- explain the relationship between a regression coefficient and a correlation coefficent in words, equations, and pictures
- compare and contrast extrapolation and interpolation
- compare and contrast outliers, leverage, and influence

Note that in this class we are going to do this with single predictor models and next class we will do this with two predictor models.


## Example: Baseball!

The movie [Moneyball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)) focuses on
the "quest for the secret of success in baseball". It follows a low-budget team, the Oakland Athletics, who believed that underused statistics, such as a player's ability to get on base, better predict the ability to score runs than typicalstatistics like home runs, RBIs (runs batted in), and batting average. Obtaining  players who excelled in these underused statistics turned out to be much more affordable for the team.

In this lab we'll be looking at data from all 30 Major League Baseball teams and
examining the linear relationship between runs scored in a season and a number 
of other player statistics. Our aim will be to summarize these relationships 
both graphically and numerically in order to find which variable, if any, helps 
us best predict a team's runs scored in a season.

## The data

Let's load up the data for the 2011 season.

```{r load-data, eval=FALSE}
load("input/mlb11.RData")
```

In addition to runs scored, there are seven traditionally used variables in the 
data set: at-bats, hits, home runs, batting average, strikeouts, stolen bases, 
and wins. There are also three newer variables: on-base percentage, slugging 
percentage, and on-base plus slugging. For the first portion of the analysis 
we'll consider the seven traditional variables. At the end of the lab, you'll 
work with the newer variables on your own.

1.  What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between `runs` 
    and one of the other numerical variables? Plot this relationship using the 
    variable `at_bats` as the predictor. Does the relationship look linear? If 
    you knew a team's `at_bats`, would you be comfortable using a linear model 
    to predict the number of runs?

If the relationship looks linear, we can quantify the strength of the
relationship with the correlation coefficient.

```{r cor, eval=FALSE}
cor(mlb11$runs, mlb11$at_bats)
```

## Sum of squared residuals

Think back to the way that we described the distribution of a single variable. 
Recall that we discussed characteristics such as center, spread, and shape. It's
also useful to be able to describe the relationship of two numerical variables, 
such as `runs` and `at_bats` above.

2.  Looking at your plot from the previous exercise, describe the relationship 
    between these two variables. Make sure to discuss the form, direction, and 
    strength of the relationship as well as any unusual observations.

Just as we used the mean and standard deviation to summarize a single variable, 
we can summarize the relationship between these two variables by finding the 
line that best follows their association. Use the following interactive 
function to select the line that you think does the best job of going through 
the cloud of points.

```{r plotss-atbats-runs, eval=FALSE}
plot_ss(x = mlb11$at_bats, y = mlb11$runs)
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted to click two points on the plot 
to define a line. Once you've done that, the line you specified will be shown in
black and the residuals in blue. Note that there are 30 residuals, one for each 
of the 30 observations. Recall that the residuals are the difference between the
observed values and the values predicted by the line:

\[
  e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
\]

The most common way to do linear regression is to select the line that minimizes
the sum of squared residuals. To visualize the squared residuals, you can rerun 
the plot command and add the argument `showSquares = TRUE`.

```{r plotss-atbats-runs-squares, eval=FALSE}
plot_ss(x = mlb11$at_bats, y = mlb11$runs, showSquares = TRUE)
```

Note that the output from the `plot_ss` function provides you with the slope and
intercept of your line as well as the sum of squares.

3.  Using `plot_ss`, choose a line that does a good job of minimizing the sum of
    squares. Run the function several times. What was the smallest sum of 
    squares that you got? How does it compare to your neighbors?

## The linear model

It is rather cumbersome to try to get the correct least squares line, i.e. the 
line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, through trial and error. 
Instead we can use the `lm` function in R to fit the linear model (a.k.a. 
regression line).

```{r m1, eval=FALSE}
model_atbats <- lm(runs ~ at_bats, data = mlb11)
```

The first argument in the function `lm` is a formula that takes the form 
`y ~ x`. Here it can be read that we want to make a linear model of `runs` as a 
function of `at_bats`. The second argument specifies that R should look in the 
`mlb11` data frame to find the `runs` and `at_bats` variables.

The output of `lm` is an object that contains all of the information we need 
about the linear model that was just fit. We can access this information using 
the summary function.

```{r summary-m1, eval=FALSE}
summary(model_atbats)
```

Let's consider this output piece by piece. First, the formula used to describe 
the model is shown at the top. After the formula you find the five-number 
summary of the residuals. The "Coefficients" table shown next is key; its first 
column displays the linear model's y-intercept and the coefficient of `at_bats`.
With this table, we can write down the least squares regression line for the 
linear model:

\[
  \hat{y} = -2789.2429 + 0.6305 * atbats
\]

One last piece of information we will discuss from the summary output is the 
Multiple R-squared, or more simply, $R^2$. The $R^2$ value represents the 
proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the 
explanatory variable. For this model, 37.3% of the variability in runs is 
explained by at-bats. $R^2$ isn't great, for reasons that we will talk about, but it works just fine for bivariate regression. 

4.  Fit a new model that uses `homeruns` to predict `runs`. Using the estimates 
    from the R output, write the equation of the regression line. What does the 
    slope tell us in the context of the relationship between success of a team 
    and its home runs?
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
model_homeruns = lm(runs ~ homeruns, data = mlb11)
```

## Prediction and prediction errors

Let's create a scatterplot with the least squares line laid on top.

```{r reg-with-line, eval=FALSE}
plot(mlb11$runs ~ mlb11$at_bats)
abline(model_atbats)
```

The function `abline` plots a line based on its slope and intercept. Here, we 
used a shortcut by providing the model `m1`, which contains both parameter 
estimates. This line can be used to predict $y$ at any value of $x$. When 
predictions are made for values of $x$ that are beyond the range of the observed
data, it is referred to as *extrapolation* and is not usually recommended. 
However, predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable. 
They're also used to compute the residuals.

5.  If a team manager saw the least squares regression line and not the actual data, how many runs would he or she predict for a team with 5,578 at-bats? Is this an overestimate or an underestimate, and by how much? In other words, what is the residual for this prediction?

- We can do this by hand...

```{r eval=FALSE}
model_atbats$coefficients[1] + model_atbats$coefficients[2] * 5578
```

... or using R's prediction tools:

```{r eval=FALSE}
predict(model_atbats,newdata = data.frame('at_bats' = 5578))
```

6. Choose another traditional variable from `mlb11` that you think might be a good predictor of `runs`. Produce a scatterplot of the two variables and fit a linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?

7. How does this relationship compare to the relationship between `runs` and `at_bats`? Does your variable seem to predict `runs` better than `at_bats`? How can you tell?

8. Now that you can summarize the linear relationship between two variables, investigate the relationships between `runs` and each of the other five traditional variables. Which variable best predicts `runs`? Support your conclusion using the graphical and numerical methods we've discussed. Note: find a way to do this that **does not** require you to type out 7 different models

```{r eval=FALSE}
forms = paste0('runs~',names(mlb11 %>% select(-team,-runs)))
model.results = lapply(forms,lm,data=mlb11)
coef.df = ldply(model.results,coef) #use `ldply` in plyr package to make coefficient dataframe
names(coef.df) = c('intercept','slope'); coef.df$x.variable = names(mlb11 %>% select(-team,-runs))
coef.df$AIC = lapply(model.results,AIC)
```

You can probably come up with a more efficient way of doing this than I did...

9. Now examine the three newer variables. These are the statistics used by the A's as key indicators of success. In general, are they more or less effective at predicting runs than the old variables? Explain using appropriate graphical and numerical evidence. Of all ten variables we've analyzed, which seems to be the best predictor of `runs`? Using the limited (or not so limited) information you know about these baseball statistics, does your result make sense?

##Example 2: "Advances in Development Reverse Fertility Declines"

Next we will work with the recent, important paper in Nature by Mikko Myrskyla, Hans-Peter Kohler & Francesco C. Billari (2009).  This paper examined the relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in 143 countries.  

10. Download: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/extref/nature08230-s2.zip    

11. Read the data into R (`read.csv`)

```{r message=FALSE}
nature = read.csv('input/nature08230-s2.csv')
```

12. Drop all but the HDI and TFR for 1975 and 2005 (use dplyr)

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
nature <- nature %>% select(country,HDI.1975,HDI.2005,TFR.1975,TFR.2005)
```

13. Explore the dataset. Make some plots. Do some calculations. What do you see?

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = nature,aes(x=HDI.1975,y=TFR.1975)) + geom_point()
```

14. Use "lm(y ~ x)" to regress TFR on HDI for 1975. 

```{r}
model_hdi1975 <- lm(TFR.1975~HDI.1975,data=nature)
summary(model_hdi1975)
```

15. What is the observed relationship?  

16. Use the coefficient in a sentence.  

17. Interpret the constant.  
 
## Notes about an lm() Object

- lm() doesn't just spit out values, it stores anything you could ever need  
- Use "str(model_hdi)" to look at the structure of linear model fit object. What's inside?  
- Can you print the coefficients?  
- Add the regression line to your scatter plot. 
- Can you print the true TFR and the predicted TFR side by side? (you will need to address the missing data issue)   
- Instead of summary(lfit), try installing and using the "broom" package. Which one do you like better? (see ??broom for more information)
 
## Residuals

[Fortify and ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/0.9.3.1/fortify.lm.html)   

The `fortify` function can help you do more with your linear model objects by generating a dataframe containing model residuals (and a whole bunch of other things that we will talk about in two weeks...). Also, note that the fortify function can be used on all sorts of other objects as well - it's a powerfull tool intended to make all sorts of plotting tasks easier. 

```{r message=FALSE,results='hide'}
resid1975.df = fortify(model_hdi1975)
```

- Make a new scatter plot of the residuals versus the fitted values.    

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
ggplot(data=resid1975.df) + geom_point(aes(x=.fitted,y=.resid))
```

## Comparing 1975 to 2005

18. Return to the original HDI-TFR scatter plot and add the 2005 data to your scatter plot in red (change the axis titles and see if you can add a legend to make this new figure more "publishable")

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = nature,aes(x=HDI.1975,y=TFR.1975)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = nature,aes(x=HDI.2005,y=TFR.2005),col='red') 
```

19. Perform the HDI on TFR regression for 2005 data.  

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
model_hdi2005 = lm(TFR.2005~HDI.2005,data=nature)
```

20. Add the new regression line to your plot.  

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = nature,aes(x=HDI.1975,y=TFR.1975)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(aes(slope=model_hdi1975$coefficients[2],intercept = model_hdi1975$coefficients[1]))+
geom_point(data = nature,aes(x=HDI.2005,y=TFR.2005),col='red') +
geom_abline(
  aes(intercept = model_hdi2005$coefficients[1],slope=model_hdi2005$coefficients[2]),col='red')
```

21. Did the relationship change from 1975 to 2005?   

22. Make some aesthetic improvements to the graph

23. Make a new scatter plot of the residuals versus the fitted values for the 2005 data.
